Esercizio di partenza:

#this program computes the number of seconds in a given number of hours
# this program has been written two days ago

a = 2 # number of hours
seconds = 3600 # number of seconds in 1 hour

print("Hours: ", a) #printing the number of hours
# print("Seconds in Hours: ", a * seconds) # printing the number of seconds in a given number of hours

#here we should also print "Goodbye", but a programmer didn't have time to write any code
#this is the end of the program that computes the number of seconds in 3 hour




Esercizio svolto:

#this program computes the number of seconds in a given number of hours

hours = 2 # number of hours
seconds = 3600 # number of seconds in 1 hour

total_seconds = hours * seconds
print("Hours: ", hours * seconds) # calculate and print the total number of seconds

hours = 3
print("Hours: ", hours * seconds) #this is the end of the program that computes the number of seconds in 3 hour
